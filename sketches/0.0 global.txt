You are a person stuck on an island. There is something magical about the island but you don't what that is. Somehow things appear - a fish and a message in a bottle. The fish will be able to sell you his services which are oysters and wood. With the wood and the map you get from the bottle, you are able to travel to land. Your memories are really blurry and you need to find your way again in this mysterious world.

In the house you find a spear and images of some person. You don't know who it is. The house is haunted according to a squirrel who lives in the tree.

You'll travel further to Cliffhill town and the Forest of Protectors. In Cliffhill town there are people that recognize you. They know who you are and are able to tell your name (you have to fill in your name in some bucket). There is a tavern, a castle, a few shops and some houses. In the tavern there's a man who recognizes you. The castle is shut because the king is on vacation. In the shops you can buy armor, some weapons and there's a weird stone one of the vendors is selling.

In the forest of protectors you can fight certain enemies. You have to walk through to get to the end of the forest. After the end of the forest you'll receive a key for your deeds.

You'll go through the forest which has lots of routes and trickery.
The key will fit on a door. But not the door in the haunted house. Some door in cliffhill city.

In cliffhill town in the house with the key. There's a man who can tell you what happened a few weeks ago; that there was a storm and that you probably were on a boat with the rest of your men. And that's why you stranded on that dreadfull island.

He has a reward for you but only if you can fix his roof, fix his door and fix his floor.
It all has a price. You can gather wood if you go through the forest. There are lots of enemies that leave wood as a reward. if you have fixed all of this stuff from him. He'll give you his reward.

The reward is a part of your story and a piece of the map.

On the map three spots appear. One spot is called ?? you can't enter yet because your MP is too low. The other two are easily accessible. One place is called Tremeloe Town and the other place is Sideous Cave

In tremeloe town, there are more people knowing you. There are only a few residents that wnat to go to Cliffhill town. Since that is impossible because there's water between the two areas. You are able to build a bridge between the two towns. This will cost you a serious amount of wood but will make the people more happy.
The residents of Tremeloe Town will help you to restore your memory and some of them saw a boat further south.

In Sideous cave there are multiple enemies to fight, lots of treasures to discover and magical abilities to learn. It's good for training. At the end of Sideous Cave there's a small town called Sideous Town.

--
Global goal: go back to the boat, people know that it is somewhere but they have no specific details.
--

When you finally reach the boat. You have to beat a large jellyfish in order to enter the boat. When you enter the boat you get a flashback from what happened to you and what the goal of the ship was. The goal was to inform the king of Cliffhill Town of a great danger. When you finally find out, you are too late, that is when you have to go back to Cliffhill Town which isn't going to be that easy. Everywhere are enemies.

--
Global goal: get rid of the danger. Save the king of Cliffhill Town
--

When you saved the king. You'll receive lots of rewards from the King and you are able to make your final move on the opposition. Once the opposition is beaten, you find out that the king is actually responsible for his own attacks on his city. He did it so he could apply new rules to control the people of Cliffhill town. You find out the truth and return to the king. The king knows that you know the truth and will try to eliminate you. In a final standdown between you and the king you'll show that you are worthy of the crown and you become king!
