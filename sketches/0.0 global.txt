You are a person stuck on an island. There is something magical about the island but you don't what that is. Somehow things appear - a fish and a message in a bottle. The fish will be able to sell you his services which are oysters and wood. With the wood and the map you get from the bottle, you are able to travel to land. Your memories are really blurry and you need to find your way again in this mysterious world.

In the house you find a spear and images of some person. You don't know who it is. The house is haunted according to a squirrel who lives in the tree.

You'll travel further to Cliffhill town and the Forest of Protectors. In Cliffhill town there are people that recognize you. They know who you are and are able to tell your name (you have to fill in your name in some bucket). There is a tavern, a castle, a few shops and some houses. In the tavern there's a man who recognizes you. The castle is shut because the king is on vacation. In the shops you can buy armor, some weapons and there's a weird stone one of the vendors is selling.

In the forest of protectors you can fight certain enemies. You have to walk through to get to the end of the forest. After the end of the forest you'll receive a key for your deeds.

You'll go through the forest which has lots of routes and trickery.
The key will fit on a door. But not the door in the haunted house. Some door in cliffhill city.

In cliffhill town in the house with the key. There's a man who can tell you what happened a few weeks ago; that there was a storm and that you probably were on a boat with the rest of your men. And that's why you stranded on that dreadfull island.

He has a reward for you but only if you can fix his roof, fix his door and fix his floor.
It all has a price. You can gather wood if you go through the forest. There are lots of enemies that leave wood as a reward. if you have fixed all of this stuff from him. He'll give you his reward.

The reward is a part of your story and a piece of the map.

On the map three spots appear. One spot is called ?? you can't enter yet because your MP is too low. The other two are easily accessible. One place is called Tremeloe Town and the other place is Sideous Cave

In tremeloe town, there are lots of people knowing you.
